When we got back home, it was already evening. After putting away our bags, everyone felt a little hungry. Mom cooked a simple dinner in the kitchen with soup, rice, and some vegetables. Even though it wasn’t as rich as the food in the restaurant, it felt very warm. After dinner, we all sat in the living room and looked at the photos. My little brother laughed while looking at himself on the boat, saying he looked very funny. Dad printed out his favorite photos and put them on the wall.

The next day, we stayed at home to rest. In the morning I helped Mom organize the luggage, putting the fruits and gifts into different places. The scarf for Grandma was placed into a nice bag, ready to be given to her on the weekend. My brother played with the toy he bought at the market all afternoon. Dad sat at the computer writing a travel diary, saying it would be fun to read again in the future.

On the weekend, we went to visit Grandma. She was very happy when she saw the scarf and kept saying thank you. She asked us if we were tired on the trip and if we ate well. We told her many stories, and she listened carefully, smiling and nodding. She said we should travel more often because we can learn a lot that way. In the evening, she made her best dumplings, and the whole family sat together eating happily.ome, it was already evening. After putting away our bags, everyone felt a little hungry.

In the following days, my brother and I went back to school. The teacher asked us to write an essay called “My Favorite Trip.” I wrote about the park’s lake and the museum’s old clock, while my brother wrote about the rabbit on the mountain. After reading our work, the teacher praised us for writing carefully and asked us to read it to the class. Many classmates said they wanted to visit that city too.

Even though the trip was over, we often talked about those days at the dinner table. Mom said she wanted to go to the beach next time, Dad said we could try climbing a higher mountain, and my brother wanted to go to the zoo. I also wondered what our next trip would be like.

A few weeks later, the weather started to get warmer. One evening, while we were having dinner, Dad suggested planning our next trip. Mom agreed right away and said it would be nice to go somewhere different from last time. My brother shouted that he wanted to see lions and elephants, so he kept talking about the zoo. I thought going to the beach would be fun, because I had never seen the ocean before.

That weekend, we sat together in the living room with a map on the table. Dad pointed to a city near the sea, which also had a big zoo. Mom said it was perfect because everyone could see something they liked. We started searching for hotels and looking at pictures online. The blue ocean looked beautiful, and the zoo had many animals I had only seen in books. My brother was so excited he couldn’t stop talking.

During the next few days, we made plans for the trip. Mom wrote a list of things we needed to bring, like clothes, hats, and sunscreen. Dad checked the train tickets and found a good time to go. My brother kept asking how many days were left until we left, and he even made a countdown on his notebook. I prepared my camera, hoping to take better photos this time.

Finally, the day of the trip came. We woke up early in the morning and went to the train station. The train moved quickly, and outside the window we saw fields, rivers, and small towns. Everyone was in a good mood. My brother sat by the window and pointed at everything he saw, while Mom gave us snacks to eat. After a few hours, we could smell the salty air of the sea, and soon we arrived at the city near the beach.

The first thing we did was go to the ocean. The waves were big and the water was blue. I took off my shoes and felt the sand under my feet. My brother ran straight into the water, laughing loudly, while Dad told him to be careful. Mom stood under an umbrella, smiling as she watched us play. It was the first time I saw the ocean, and I thought it was even more beautiful than the pictures.
